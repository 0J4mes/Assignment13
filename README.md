# Mushroom Dataset Analysis - Preprocessing for scikit-learn

## Assignment Overview
This project completes the IS 362 assignment on preprocessing data for scikit-learn. The analysis focuses on the famous UCI Mushroom Dataset to determine which attributes are the best predictors of whether a mushroom is poisonous or edible.

## Dataset Information
